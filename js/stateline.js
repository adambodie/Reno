Clearly a border town, Stateline is Nevada's Tahoe resort town, with towering hotels dominating the view upon entering the town, four in total: Hard Rock, Harvey's, Harrah's and Montbleu, each with their own charm and character.  I walked around admiring the hotels, and eventually, I reached the California border, where the city of South Lake Tahoe is.</p><p>It's hard to determine where the exact border is, but I managed to get my picture at the California Border, crossed the street and got my picture are the Nevada Border on the other side.  It's cool to be able to walk across a border, and not have to worry about pointless walls or gushing rivers. When I was done walking across borders, I continued my Lake Tahoe trip, this part in California.</p></div>";
