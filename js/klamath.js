The one place I knew I would be able to stop for lunch was Klamath Falls, with a population of about 21,000.  So I headed up to Klamath Falls after visiting the Lava Beds National Monument knowing two things: My Dad used to do business down at Klamath Falls and always spent the night while there, and now was the best time to stop in Klamath Falls to say I've been to Klamath Falls.</p><p>After grabbing a quick lunch and free Dutch Brothers, I briefly stopped at a park along Klamath Fall's Upper Klamath Lake, a rather nice and large lake with plenty of views.  There were a lot of seagulls flying around, I managed to get a picture of one in the act, which I liked.  I didn't intend to spend much time in Klamath Falls, so after I was done walking, I headed north on US 97, where there were plenty of views of the lake alongside the highway.  Another construction zone allowed me to get a few pictures, but I really got happy when great views of Mt. McLoughlin showed up.  I love mountain views along a body of water, so I snapped a couple of pictures.  After I left the area, it was time for my last stop: Salt Creek Falls</p></div>";
