    paragraph +="<p>It was lunch time and I didn't want to eat at the hotel or neighboring hotels, so I sought fast food we don't get in Portland.  That led me to Fatburger in a shopping mall just north of the Interstate.  Sadly, it was closed for repairs, ruining an Ice Cube hip-hop reference from 'It Was A Good Day' in my show.  Fortunately, I had a backup plan (like everyone should).  That led me to Weinerschnitzel, where I enjoyed a Chili Dog and Fries.  Now it was time to seek some local beer.</p>";
    paragraph +="<p>I headed to Great Basin Brewing Company to enjoy one tasty yet not overly alcohol-packed beer, a Session beer I could have one and not notice a thing.  I know my limit.  There I enjoyed a Cerveza Chilebeso, a pilsner-styled beer made with jalapenos.  It was well done, having a nice jalapeno taste without the jalapeno hotness.  As the nice bartender described it to me, they took the seeds out prior to brewing to give that effect.  A tasty chili beer, a style I don't see much but mostly like (as long as it's not hot for the sake of being hot.  I had a beer like that once and it was not fun to drink to say the least).  I also sampled two other beers while I was there, a Berliner Weissbier and a Witbier.  Gotta love them Weissbiers.  A nice way to spend the hour without walking too much.  Once I was done, I made my way back to the hotel.</p>";
    paragraph +="<p>There was one place first I wanted to see, the Atlantis Resort nearby.  It towered above the other buildings in the area and looked impressive, so I stopped there and walked inside for a few moments to check out their casinos.  Definitely a ritzy type of place.  I've never seen an escalator go to a small platform connected to another escalator.  That was neat looking.  I didn't need to spend too much time there, so I left and returned to Circus Circus, straight down Virginia Street.</p>";
    paragraph +="<p>There was one more place I wanted to see before I left, and that was the National Bowling Museum.  I could see the big ball from my window and had to see it up close.  I'm glad I did, pretty cool looking.  With that said, bowling brings out the worst in me when it comes to competition.  I don't know why.  Either way, I was done sightseeing in Reno.  I hung out at my room when I was back, even watching Earl's favorite, Jeopardy.  What a joy.</p></div>";
