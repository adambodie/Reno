    paragraph +="<p>Wanting to see some sights when I got there, despite being tired, I couldn't stop, so I walked around a few blocks from my hotel.  There are three hotels connected to one another as part of the El Dorado Resorts family, with Circus Circus being the northernmost hotel of the three.  The other two were Silver Legacy, which was easy to spot with its giant sphere, and the El Dorado, which looked the classiest of the three.  I could have easily walked the skyway from one end to another without going outside.  I didn't figure that out until Wednesday, but still helpful to avoid the heat and the weirdos.</p>";
    paragraph +="<p>The end of my first walk was to perhaps Reno's most iconic landmark, the Reno Arch.  I saw it first in the evening, a nice three block walk from the Circus Circus North Tower (which was closer to Virginia Street, where the Arch was located).  After struggling to get to sleep from the excitement, I returned at dark to get some nice pictures lit up at night.  It was there I wound up with a picture holding a bell.  So how did I wind up with a bell?</p>";
    paragraph += "<p>While taking a picture, I was approached by someone who asked me to hold the bell for a picture, something akin of a 'Where in the World has the Bell been' as part of some work joke.  I thought it was funny enough to ask for a picture of me holding the bell.  And so explains the oddest thing that happened to me in Reno.</p>";
    paragraph +="<p>Next stop was Mt. Shasta, the city which is named after the mountain itself.  Of course, there were plenty of views of Mt. Shasta, with a different angle showcasing both the main peak and its sister cone Shastina.  A nice charming little town, I stopped to have some lunch at a cafe named Wassayaks.  A funny named restaurant with charm, I had myself a bagel sandwich with a Cuban Espresso, complete with Whipped Cream and a dash of cayenne pepper on top.  Quite delicious.  It was a nice way to finish my first leg of the trip, as I needed to go southeast from Mt. Shasta (city) and make my way to my next stop.</p></div>";
