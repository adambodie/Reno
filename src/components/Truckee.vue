			<p>After exploring Circus Circus, I decided to walk past the Reno Arch to see what I could find. After all, the map indicated the Truckee River wasn't too far, and walking along the river is always nice and relaxing. Plenty of fun things are found by the river, and reaching the Truckee Riverwalk, I was surprised with how elegant it was. The river itself was perfect for its surroundings, desert-like but with plenty of water flowing through, with rocks visible indicating its dry area, but with plenty of buildings around, had a nice festive feel to it. I even saw a building with a giant Masons logo on it, that of course, made me think of Grandpa. Along the riverwalk was a nice man-made waterfall and fountains showcasing the elegance of the area. I was impressed and surprised. An unexpected delight.</p>
			<p>I also found an open space with a beautiful sculpture that simply said 'Believe,' the type of uplifting message people really need these days. Negativity and Fear are not acceptable mottos to me, and I will believe in the best. That's what we live for. I didn't spend too much time at the Truckee Riverwalk, but was impressed with its presentation. I later returned in the afternoon for a better picture of the Believe sculpture, and though hotter, it was worth the walk since it wasn't too far from the hotel. By then, I had learned I could walk from Circus Circus to Eldorado without going outside.</p>
