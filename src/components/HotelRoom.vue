			<p>I finally reached Reno at around 6:00 pm, exhausted from the drive.  I got to the hotel and checked in, telling the hotel clerk on any room preference 'The higher the better.'  With that said, I headed up to my hotel room at the Sky Tower, Room 1676.  The room was big with a king sized bed, TV, bathroom and a great view dominated by the Circus Circus North Tower and surrounding area.  Suffice to say, I got great views at all times of the day; midday, sunrise, sunset, etc.  Lovely views at all times of the day.  I was impressed, especially for the 3-night $140 dollars I paid (which included tax, but who cares, still a good deal in my eyes), much better than $175 per night that the sign on the door had.</p>
			<p>After I checked in my room and checking up with my Mom, I was ready to eat.  I didn't want to drive anymore, so I stayed at the Circus Circus and one of its five dinner options.  The American and Mexican places were busy, so I went to the Sushi place for all-you-can-eat sushi.  Good, but I wasn't that hungry so I didn't get my moneys worth.  Oh well, I didn't care.  After I was done with dinner, I wanted to walk a little and see some nearby sights, but more on that later...</p>
			<p>I turned on the TV after I decided to crash for the night, and it brought up a message with my name on it.  After agreeing to the acknowledgment, the main screen, which also had my name, looked like a video game UI, with options to choose from.  I only needed the TV, so I watched TV.  The bathroom was also nice and spacious, but the light was above the mirror and made the shower dark when I was in there.  That was my biggest issue if I had one.  Otherwise, I thought it was a nice hotel room.  Non-smoking floor, also a plus, and I was just a couple doors down from the Ice Machine, which was nice.  There was a little screaming from the other rooms at night, mainly the last night, but I've dealt with worse...</p>
