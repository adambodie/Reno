			<p>It was lunch time and I didn't want to eat at the hotel or neighboring hotels, so I sought fast food we don't get in Portland. That led me to Fatburger in a shopping mall just north of downtown. Sadly, it was closed for repairs, ruining an Ice Cube hip-hop reference from 'It Was A Good Day' in my show. Fortunately, I had a backup plan (like everyone should in life). That led me to Weinerschnitzel, where I enjoyed a Chili Dog and Fries. I loooooooove Chili Dogs. Now it was time to try some local beer.</p>
			<p>I headed to Great Basin Brewing Company to enjoy one tasty yet not overly alcohol-packed beer, a Session beer I could have one and not notice a thing alcohol-wise. I know my limit. There I enjoyed a Cerveza Chilebeso, a pilsner-styled beer made with jalapenos. It was well done, having a nice jalapeno taste without the jalapeno hotness. As the nice bartender described it to me, they took the seeds out prior to brewing to give it that effect. A tasty jalapeno-spiced beer, a style I don't see much but mostly like (as long as it's not hot for the sake of being hot. I had a beer like that once and it was not fun to drink to say the least). I also sampled two other beers while I was there, a Berliner Weissbier and a Witbier. Gotta love them Weissbiers. A nice way to spend the hour without walking too much. Once I was done, I made my way back to the hotel.</p>
			<p>There was one place first I wanted to see, the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa nearby. It towered above the other buildings in the area and looked impressive, so I stopped there and walked inside for a few moments to check out their casinos. Definitely a ritzy type of place. I've never seen an escalator go to a small platform connected to another escalator. That was neat looking. I didn't need to spend too much time there, so I left and returned to Circus Circus, straight down Virginia Street.</p>
			<p>After a little rest at my hotel room, I went to the last place I wanted to see nearby before I left, and that was the National Bowling Museum. I could see the big ball from my window and had to see it up close. I'm glad I did, it was pretty cool looking. With that said, bowling brings out the worst in me when it comes to competition. I don't know why. Either way, I was done sightseeing in Reno. I hung out at my room when I was back, even watching Earl's favorite, Jeopardy. What a joy.</p>
			<p>I had my last dinner at a seafood place called Pearl at the Silver Legacy. Again, I didn't need to walk outside to get there. I had some coconut prawns and a Sauvignon Blanc. A tasty last meal in Reno, and not what I usually eat. By the time I was done with dinner, which I ate early, I was done and read to get going and prepare for the long ride home. It was convenient that I could check out of my room simply by going through instructions on my TV and drop the key in a dropbox on each floor. Definitely convenient so I didn't have to walk all the way to the front entrance on the North Tower. Pretty slick!</p>
